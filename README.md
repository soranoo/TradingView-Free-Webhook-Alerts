:information_source: I will keep looking for other better IMAP services.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions.


## :old_key: Features
* No Pro/Pro+/Premium TradingView account requested.
  
## :triangular_flag_on_post: How it works ?
Listen to the email inbox and transfer the TradingView alert email into the webhook message.


## :anchor: Requirements
* Python 3.6 or latest (*Developed in Python 3.8.1)
* An IMAP available email account (eg.Hotmail, Outlook, etc.)
  * Hotmail have be tested and works well
* A TradingView account

## :space_invader: Getting Started
To install **TradingView-Free-Webhook-Alerts**, check out the [Getting Started guide](docs/gettingstarted.md).


## :mailbox_with_mail: Notice
* The program will read the incoming email and mark it as read.
* It is suggested to create a new email account for the best performance and risk management.
* The webhook message will not be sent immediately due to the latency of the email service provider & TradingView. It will normally take about **2-8 seconds** before the webhook message is sent. (**mainly depends on the network traffic between TradingView and your email service provider**) Please consider carefully before using the program for fast-moving markets.

## :right_anger_bubble: Combination
You can combine the program with other services.
For example,
* You may use [TradingView-Webhook-Bot](https://github.com/fabston/TradingView-Webhook-Bot) to spread the webhook message.
* You may send a webhook to [3commas](https://3commas.io/) for auto trading.
* You may send a webhook to [Discord](https://discord.com/) for sharing the signal.

## :star: TODO
* Remove all potential risks that may be caused by the program, for example, Outlook account was locked because of high-frequency IMAP action.

## :bug: Known Issues
* N/A
