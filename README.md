> The ngrok Docker version setup is similar to the ngrok local version so I am not going to make a tutorial video for it.

## üì∫ Support Broadcast Methods

> The term "Broadcast" means sending your TradingView alerts to multiple destinations.

| | Webhook<sup>1</sup> | Telegram |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Local (traditional)** | Supported | Supported |
| **Local (ngrok)** | Supported | Supported |
| **Docker (ngrok)** | Supported | Supported |
| **Cloud** | Supported | Supported<sup>2</sup> |

1. All applications support Webhook, for example, Discord, 3commas, etc.
2. [Telegram Alert #58](https://github.com/soranoo/TradingView-Free-Webhook-Alerts/discussions/58#discussioncomment-7658366)


## üì¨ Notice
#### Local (traditional)
* The program will read the incoming email and mark it as read.
* It is suggested to create a new email account for the best performance and risk management.
* The webhook message will not be sent immediately due to the latency of the email service provider & TradingView. It will normally take about **2-8 seconds** before the webhook message is sent. (**mainly depends on the network traffic between TradingView and your email service provider**) Please consider carefully before using the program for fast-moving markets.

## ü¶î Potential Risk
#### Local (traditional)
* Email accounts may be locked because of high-frequency IMAP action.
    - Reports have been received that some user was locked by Outlook.

## üóØÔ∏è Combination
You can combine the program with other services.
For example,
* You may use [TradingView-Webhook-Bot](https://github.com/fabston/TradingView-Webhook-Bot) to spread the webhook message.
* You may send a webhook to [3commas](https://3commas.io/) for auto trading.
* You may send a webhook to [Discord](https://discord.com/) for sharing the signal.

## :question: FAQ
* **Q: Some exchnage banned my IP. What should I do?**
    - A: You may use a proxy to bypass the IP ban. You should see there is a proxy option in the config file. Related issue: [#69](https://github.com/soranoo/TradingView-Free-Webhook-Alerts/issues/69)
