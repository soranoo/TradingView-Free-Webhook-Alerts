## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
1. `webhook_urls` - Webhook URLs you want to send the alert to. You can add multiple URLs by separating them with a comma.
```python
# Single URL:
webhook_urls = [
    r"https://mywebhook.com/1",
]

# Multi URLs:
webhook_urls = [
    r"https://mywebhook.com/1",
    r"https://mywebhook.com/2",
    r"https://mywebhook.com/3",
    # ...
]
```
> [!NOTE]\
> It is a good idea to test your signal or the program using a webhook test service such as [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) instead of using your production webhook.
2. `discord_webhook_url` - (Optional) Discord webhook URL. Mainly for logging purposes. Leave it blank if you don't want to use it.
